## Purpose
RankNation is designed to provide sports fans with a clean, intuitive platform to quickly access
current standings and breaking news across multiple major sports leagues. The primary goal is to
deliver up-to-date statistics in an easily scannable format that allows users to efficiently compare
team performances within a league.


## Reasoning
Sports enthusiasts often need to check standings across multiple leagues but are frequently
confronted with cluttered websites filled with advertisements, unnecessary graphics, and
distracting elements. RankNation addresses this pain point by offering a streamlined interface
focused solely on essential information. The consistency across different sports pages reduces
the learning curve and cognitive load, allowing users to navigate effortlessly between leagues
while maintaining familiarity with the layout.
